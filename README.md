### Hello there! :wave:  
This project is under development. Therefore, every user of our framework is bound by **the principle of confidentiality**.  
    
## Branches  
Branch | Description  
--- | ---  
`main` | Main branch is branch with our stable version data.  
`beta` | Beta branch is for users, who love getting features before others.  
`dev` | Development branch is for development purposes. It is a risky idea to use it as the main source of the framework as there is a high probability of an error
